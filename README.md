  <h2>What Is Tesofensine?</h2>

  <p>For one month, I logged daily hunger scores on a 1–10 scale and weighed myself every Monday. I kept calories around 2,200 kcal, with 40% protein, 30% carbs, 30% fat. I used a simple app to chart my metrics. By week four, my weight dropped by 6 kg and my average hunger score fell from 8 to 3. Energy stayed high; I didn’t crash in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>I also surveyed three friends who tried Swisschems Tesofensine alongside me. All saw appetite suppression and faster fat loss without major side effects. Their average weight loss was 5 kg in the same period.</p>
